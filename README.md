<br>

Technologies:-<br>
libraries:-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDL2 - We decided to pick SDL2 over RAYlib. Although RAYlib is a lightweight library and easier to learn compared to SDL2, SDL2 is more versatile and offers a comprehensive feature set which will help us to do more creative things in our project.<br>
frameworks:-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flask - We chose to stick with Flask over other web frameworks because it is simple, minimalistic and Pythonic.<br>
languages:-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python<br>
platforms:-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Git & GitHub<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux<br>
Code Editors and IDEs:-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Studio Code<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vim<br>
resources<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Online documentation for relevant technologies and frameworks<br>
challenge statement:-<br>
Goal:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve brain skills in problem-solving and enhance memory skills through an engaging and enjoyable experience.<br>
Limitations:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a Maze game, what should it be supposed to solve? just providing an engaging maze game experience.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game doesnâ€™t contain enemies except the maze itself.<br>
Target users:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyone seeking an entertaining gaming experience.<br>
Local relevance:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project is intended to be globally accessible.  It is not confined to a specific locale.<br>
Risks:-<br>
Technical risks:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor game performance, such as slow rendering or lag.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data loss or corruption could result in players losing progress or achievements.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poorly designed or confusing UI elements can lead to user dissatisfaction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected bugs because of lack of testing.<br>
Non-technical risks:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unauthorized use of copyrighted material, including images, sounds,..etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure all game assets are either created manually or properly licensed to all users to be under fair use.<br>
Infrastructure:-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team uses GitHub Flow workflow to manage the process for branching and merging.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will use Ramped Deployment as a deployment strategy by gradually changing the older version to the newer version of the game.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The app will be populated with content which we have created manually by us or by the user of the game. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our testing process will be conducted manually to assess user experience, gameplay mechanics, and overall quality.<br>
