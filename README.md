Technologies:-
libraries:-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDL2 - We decided to pick SDL2 over RAYlib. Although RAYlib is a lightweight library and easier to learn compared to SDL2, SDL2 is more versatile and offers a comprehensive feature set which will help us to do more creative things in our project.
frameworks:-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flask - We chose to stick with Flask over other web frameworks because it is simple, minimalistic and Pythonic.
languages:-
	C
	Python
platforms:-
	Git & GitHub
	Linux
Code Editors and IDEs:-
	Visual Studio Code
	Vim
resources
	Online documentation for relevant technologies and frameworks
challenge statement:-
Goal:
	Improve brain skills in problem-solving and enhance memory skills through an engaging and enjoyable experience.
Limitations:
	It's a Maze game, what should it be supposed to solve? just providing an engaging maze game experience.
	The game doesnâ€™t contain enemies except the maze itself.
Target users:
	anyone seeking an entertaining gaming experience.
Local relevance:
	The project is intended to be globally accessible.  It is not confined to a specific locale.
Risks:-
Technical risks:
	Poor game performance, such as slow rendering or lag.
	Data loss or corruption could result in players losing progress or achievements.
	Poorly designed or confusing UI elements can lead to user dissatisfaction.
	Unexpected bugs because of lack of testing.
Non-technical risks:
	Unauthorized use of copyrighted material, including images, sounds,..etc.
	Ensure all game assets are either created manually or properly licensed to all users to be under fair use.
Infrastructure:-
	Our team uses GitHub Flow workflow to manage the process for branching and merging.
	We will use Ramped Deployment as a deployment strategy by gradually changing the older version to the newer version of the game.
	The app will be populated with content which we have created manually by us or by the user of the game. 
	Our testing process will be conducted manually to assess user experience, gameplay mechanics, and overall quality.
Existing solutions:-
	3D Maze / Labyrinth (Android / IOS):
Similarities:
	Emphasis on exploration and discovery.
Differences:
	More complex with a focus on memory.
	Ability to construct your map.
